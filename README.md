# Youtube-Controller

## What does it do?
You know how sometimes we have a lot of tabs open, and in one of those tabs we have a youtube video playing with some music or podcast.
Its annoying to find that tab and go forward or backward in the video or what if i want to listen to my song from the start.
So to solve that problem i created a chrome extension!!
